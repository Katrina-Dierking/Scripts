# Scripts - Vision

_*Developing and communicating a long-term vision both justifies the work and guides the work._

## Intelligent

There has never been a more exciting time to be tech-enabled. The world has increasing levels of intelligent systems [[0]](https://iot-analytics.com/state-of-the-iot-update-q1-q2-2018-number-of-iot-devices-now-7b). How well you leverage these systems will impact your life. The individual that can tap into the potential of the digital world will see better, move faster, and be stronger.

## Agile

The command-line interface (CLI) [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) is for the power user. Writing scripts is the fastest way to build, deploy, and maintain real-world solutions. Unlike web or mobile apps, which have many moving parts, a script is often a single file with less than 300 lines of code.

## Emergent

When written in a way to allow chaining functionality scripts produce emergent behavior. The output of one script can become the input of another and so on. Also designs of previous scripts inform the designs of newer scripts. The emergence of functionality and design accelerates with each new script.
